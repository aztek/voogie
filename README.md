# voogie

A translator of a subset of the [Boogie](https://github.com/boogie-org/boogie) intermediate verification language to [FOOL](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-20615-8_5) [TPTP](http://www.cs.miami.edu/~tptp/). At the time this translator is being implemented, only the [**V**ampire](http://vprover.org/) theorem prover fully supports FOOL.
